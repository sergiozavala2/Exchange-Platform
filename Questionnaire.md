### Questionnaire
1. Are there any sub-optimal choices( or short cuts taken due to limited time ) in your implementation?
   Yes, some parts of my code are repetitive if I had more time I would create a function and call this function instead of writing the code every time.
   Also, depending on the device that your viewing the webpage it may not appear the same as on the 1920Ã—1080 screen. 
   
2. Is any part of it over-designed? ( It is fine to over-design to showcase your skills as long as you are clear about it)
   The logos that I included. Also, changing the background to black at the end.

3. If you have to scale your solution to 100 users/second traffic what changes would you make, if any?
   I would have to change platforms because CoinAPI allows me to make 100 calls in 24 hours. 

4. What are some other enhancements you would have made, if you had more time to do this implementation
   I hwould make the web page more interactive to the users. I would add graphs, and more cryptocurrencies I currently have Bitcoin and Ethereum. 
   Add current news about cryptocurrencies.
